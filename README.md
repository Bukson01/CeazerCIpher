## Caesar Cipher MATLAB Implementation
The Caesar Cipher MATLAB Implementation is a simple encryption and decryption tool based on the classic Caesar cipher algorithm. This implementation allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified key.

# How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.
- Run the CaesarCipher.m script.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message, specify the encryption key, and input the message to be processed.
- The resulting encrypted or decrypted message will be displayed in the MATLAB console.

# Features
- Interactive interface for easy encryption and decryption.
- Supports encryption and decryption of messages using a specified key.
- Modular and well-organized code structure.
- Option to copy the resulting message to the clipboard (if supported by the MATLAB environment).

# Requirements
- MATLAB software installed on your computer.
